FILERECOVERY® is a safe and affordable do-it-yourself data recovery solution designed to recover lost and deleted files from all types of media such as hard drives, optical drives, flash media drives and multimedia or mobile devices.

In computing, data recovery is a process of retrieving deleted, inaccessible, lost, corrupted, damaged, or overwritten data from [secondary storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage#Secondary_storage), [removable media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removable_media) or files, when the data stored in them cannot be accessed in a usual way.The data is most often salvaged from storage media such as internal or external [hard disk drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) (HDDs), [solid-state drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) (SSDs), [USB flash drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive), [magnetic tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage), CDs, DVDs, RAID subsystems, and other electronic devices. Recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage devices or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system (OS).

* Logical failures occur when the hard drive devices are functional but the user or automated-OS cannot retrieve or access data stored on them.
* Logical failures can occur due to corruption of the engineering chip, lost partitions, firmware failure, or failures during formatting/re-installation.

Data recovery can be a very simple or technical challenge. This is why there are specific software companies specialized in this field.

The most common data recovery scenarios involve an operating system failure, malfunction of a storage device, logical failure of storage devices, accidental damage or deletion, etc. (typically, on a single-drive, [single-partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning), single-OS system), in which case the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive. This can be accomplished using a Live CD, or DVD by booting directly from a [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory) or a USB drive instead of the corrupted drive in question. Many Live CDs or DVDs provide a means to mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media, and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software. Such cases can often be mitigated by disk partitioning and consistently storing valuable data files (or copies of them) on a different partition from the replaceable OS system files.

### Physical damage:
A wide variety of failures can cause physical damage to storage media, which may result from human errors and natural disasters. CD-ROMs can have their metallic substrate or dye layer scratched off; hard disks can suffer from a multitude of mechanical failures, such as [head crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_crash), PCB failure, and failed motors; tapes can simply break.

Physical damage to a hard drive, even in cases where a head crash has occurred, does not necessarily mean permanent data loss. However, in extreme cases, such as prolonged exposure to moisture and corrosion like the lost Bitcoin hard drive of James Howells, buried in the Newport landfill for over a decade recovery is usually impossible. In rare cases, forensic techniques like [Magnetic Force Microscopy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_force_microscope) (MFM) have been explored to detect residual magnetic traces when data holds exceptional value. Other techniques employed by many professional data recovery companies can typically salvage most, if not all, of the data that had been lost when the failure occurred.

### Recovery techniques:
Recovering data from physically damaged hardware can involve multiple techniques. Some damage can be repaired by replacing parts in the hard disk. This alone may make the disk usable, but there may still be logical damage. A specialized disk-imaging procedure is used to recover every readable bit from the surface. Once this image is acquired and saved on a reliable medium, the image can be safely analyzed for logical damage and will possibly allow much of the original file system to be reconstructed.

### Four phases of data recovery:
Usually, there are four phases when it comes to successful data recovery, though that can vary depending on the type of data corruption and recovery required.

* Phase 1
  * Repair the hard disk drive
    The hard drive is repaired in order to get it running in some form, or at least in a state suitable for reading the data from it. For example, if heads are bad they need     to be changed; if the PCB is faulty then it needs to be fixed or replaced; if the spindle motor is bad the platters and heads should be moved to a new drive.

* Phase 2
  * Image the drive to a new drive or a disk image file
    When a hard disk drive fails, the importance of getting the data off the drive is the top priority. The longer a faulty drive is used, the more likely further data loss     is to occur. Creating an image of the drive will ensure that there is a secondary copy of the data on another device, on which it is safe to perform testing and recovery     procedures without harming the source.

* Phase 3
  * Logical recovery of files, partition, MBR and filesystem structures
    After the drive has been cloned to a new drive, it is suitable to attempt the retrieval of lost data. If the drive has failed logically, there are a number of reasons       for that. Using the clone it may be possible to repair the partition table or master boot record (MBR) in order to read the file system's data structure and retrieve         stored data.

* Phase 4
  * Repair damaged files that were retrieved
    Data damage can be caused when, for example, a file is written to a sector on the drive that has been damaged. This is the most common cause in a failing drive, meaning     that data needs to be reconstructed to become readable. Corrupted documents can be recovered by several software methods or by manually reconstructing the document using     a hex editor.
